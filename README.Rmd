Exact tests for random mating in autopolyploids. We allow for genotype uncertainty through the use of genotype likelihoods and fuzzy *p*-values. The main functions are

- `tetexact()`: Exact test for random mating in autotetraploids when the genotypes are known.
- `tetgp()`: Exact test for random mating in autotetraploids using genotype posteriors.
- `vpv()`: Calculate the vacuumed *p*-value.
